## Credits:

* [Paulo Almeida](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1081569/paulo-almeida) for the idea of using the module of a number to improve the code. I found his ideia by reading the article [7 ways to code rock paper scissors in javascript](https://betterprogramming.pub/7-ways-to-code-rock-paper-scissors-in-javascript-4189a5e7e535)
